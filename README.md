# running-log-April2022
Playing around with what this code project might look like.

I'd like this web app to:
 - PROMPT user for info about run length, time, shoes used, time of day
 - USE API to pull in weather data (humidity, temperature, raining/snowing) when given zip code and time of day
 - GIVE FEEDBACK about the run; ex. "Faster than average on this route" ex. "Time to get new sneakers." ex. "You have run X/X times this week. You're on pace to hit your mileage goal of XXX." ex. 
 - VISUALIZE DATA 
 - ISSUE BADGES for milestones
